             we will cover from performing basic arithmetic operations to evaluating complex logical expressions. Here We'll learn comparison operators for making decisions based on conditions, and then explore bitwise operators for low-level manipulation of binary data. Additionally, we'll understand assignment operators for efficient variable assignment and updating, membership and identity operators.
